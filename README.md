# Reduced-order-models-ROMS-

This repository attempts to forecasting the caotic solution of the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky. The methodology can be divided into 2 parts:

1) Solving the Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation using high order finite differences.
2) Given the dataset from step 1, creating a reduced order model for the Kuramoto Shivansky equation to simplify the problem and use time series forecasting in this reduced space. After obtaining the solution with sufficient accuracy, return to the original domain to obtain the final forecasting solution.
